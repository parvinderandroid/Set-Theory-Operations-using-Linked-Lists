# Set Theory Operations using Linked List

This is a small project that showcases all the functions in a Doubly Circular Linked List and how they can be used to perform all the set operations.

# Installation

If JDK 8+ is installed, [Sets.jar](Sets.jar) is the only file that needs to be downloaded and is executable.
